interpreter
===========

interpreter for a language that I'm making
so far has if statements, for and while loops, it can call other files, create and use namable variables.
instructions:
:4 - literal 4 adds 4 to the stack:
:hello adds hello to the stack
$hello fetches the variable hello
=hello set hello
@hello run the file with the name hello
echo prints to the console etc...
stack based language, uses reverse polish notation mostly.
